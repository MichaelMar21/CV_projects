In this repo I submitted all of my personal projects that I was working with. My goal was to show every kind of skills that I have when it comes to operating with basic Machine Learning libraries like: NumPy, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas.
With comments and markdowns included in projects, I wanted to show my personal approach to topics and conclusions coming from them. Also, I tried to make my approach as transparent and understandable as possible. This repository has 4 projects:

1. Multiclassification_E_Coli_with_ANNs.ipynb - The project was created in regards to receive an experience of hands-on-practice multiclass classification with ANNs. The code includes data loading, exploration, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation,
and hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner. It iteratively explores different dataset characteristics, such as deleting highly correlated columns and handling outliers, to observe their impact on model performance.
2. Facial-expression-recognition-via-cnns.ipynb - Project was made to show different approaches that can be made with CNNs. With different difficulty levels of every Neural Network made, they were tested on dataset and compared with each other. In regards, the best was
chosen.
3.  Dow_Jones_Stock_prediction_via_RNNs.ipynb - My recent project made in Feb. 2024. I had much fun with the code and exploring such an interesting topic as predicting stock values. In comparison to other projects, approach here was different as I was working with sequenced
datasets, that I made by myself. Forecasting was done on Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks between years 2008 - 2016. To get the most satisfying results I used 3 types of Recurrent Neural Networks: SimpleRNN, GRU and LSTM.
4.  Predicting NBA match_results_code - My own engineering thesis that I completed in 2024 a AGH University student. Project is divided into 4 different ipynb files. First is a clear, short data exploration and the remaining three are codes with different Neural Networks
ncluded. I tried my best to get as good results as I read during literature research. For those more interested, I'm willing to send my whole thesis if someones interested (unfortunately written entirely in polish).
